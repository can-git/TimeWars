# TimeWars
2D Mobile Game with Unity

It is my first game project and I have started to this game for the school project. I have learned the content from an Udemy course and many changes have added rather than the original one.

To see the original project : https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/learn/lecture/12173852#overview

In a short, you are trying to defend your side by gaining coin and killing the enemies before they passed the left side of the map with your characters. And levels will being harder.

This game has only 10 levels and it has created for the school project so it will not upload to Google Play Store for now.
